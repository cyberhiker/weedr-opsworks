# postgres-hardening (Postgres cookbook)

## Description

Provides security configurations for postgres.

Note: This is currently work in progress and not tested on all supported platforms

## Requirements

* chef

## Usage

This cookbook is optimized to work with [os-hardening](https://github.com/TelekomLabs/postgres-os-hardening) and [ssh-hardening](https://github.com/TelekomLabs/chef-ssh-hardening). It will play well without, but you need to ensure all preconditions like `apt-get update` or `yum update` are met.

add the following to your runlist and customize security option attributes

```bash
  "recipe[postgresql::server]",
  "recipe[postgres-hardening]"
```

### Enable SSL

Please read http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ssl-tcp.html first. 

This cookbook will delete the links from `/var/lib/postgresql/#{node['postgresql']['version']}/main/server.crt` to `/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem` and `/var/lib/postgresql/#{node['postgresql']['version']}/main/server.key` to `/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key` on Debian systems. This certificates are self-signed (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil_%28cryptography%29) and therefore not trusted. You have to provide your own trusted certificates for SSL.

## Security Options

* `node['postgresql']['config']['logging_collector'] = true`
   This parameter enables the logging collector, which is a background process 
   that captures log messages sent to stderr and redirects them into log files. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_directory'] = 'pg_log'`
   When logging_collector is enabled, this parameter determines the 
   directory in which log files will be created. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `pg_log`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_connections'] = true`
   Causes each attempted connection to the server to be logged, as well as successful 
   completion of client authentication. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_disconnections'] = true`
   This outputs a line in the server log similar to log_connections but at session 
   termination, and includes the duration of the session. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_duration'] = true`
   Causes the duration of every completed statement to be logged 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_hostname'] = true`
   By default, connection log messages only show the IP address of the connecting host. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['log_line_prefix'] = '%t %u %d %h'`
   This is a printf-style string that is output at the beginning of each log line. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-logging.html for details
   Defaults to: `%t %u %d %h`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['password_encryption'] = true`
   When a password is specified in CREATE USER or ALTER ROLE without writing either 
   ENCRYPTED or UNENCRYPTED, this parameter determines whether the password is to be encrypted. 
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-connection.html for details
   Defaults to: `true`

* `node['postgresql']['config']['ssl'] = false`
   Enables SSL connections. Please read http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ssl-tcp.html 
   SSL certificates are out of scope of this module. This is why this setting defaults to `off`.
   You have to provide ssl certificates *before* the startup of postgres, otherwise it will fail to start.  
   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/runtime-config-connection.html for details
   Defaults to: `false`
